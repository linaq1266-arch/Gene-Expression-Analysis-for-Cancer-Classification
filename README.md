# scRNA-seq Drug Response Analysis

This project explores the effect of HDAC inhibitors on three human cancer cell lines (A549, MCF7, K562) at the single-cell transcriptomic level.

## Data
- sciPlex3 A549 / MCF7 / K562: HDACs + Vehicle
- genes_sciPlex3.csv: gene annotation

## Objective
- Analyze drug-induced transcriptional changes
- Visualize single-cell clusters using UMAP
- Identify top differentially expressed genes (HDACs vs Vehicle)
- Compare drug response across three cell lines

## Tools
Python, Scanpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## Example Visualizations
- UMAP plots for each cell line colored by drug
- Heatmaps of top 20 differentially expressed genes
- Boxplots for selected genes across drug doses

## Repository Structure
